# Autonomous-Arm-with-Object-Recognition-and-Maneuver
3D-printed robotic arm with object recognition capabilities powered by deep learning

Details of the project is given in Final Project Report

The Dataset is not provided as it was made for very specific scenario

The multi-class image_classifier_v1_3.ipynb file contains the main codes for classifier and the ouput model was saved as dumEimageclassifier.h5

classifier-tester.ipynb file contains the prediction of an image captured by camera then initializing Arduino for moving the ARM

The arduino codes are given in the Arduino Codes.docx file
